# **Central farm location (red dot)**

# **Central farm cropping**

The central farm has both double and single cropped pixels. Double cropped pixels dominate and it appears that SC and DC were planted/harvested at the same time. Perhaps the whole farm is DC and parts were misclassified as SC?

**Double cropped pixels in central farm in 2017:**

**Single cropped pixels in central farm in 2017:**

**All soy pixels in central farm in 2017:**

* <span style="color:red"> Red lines</span> correspond to planting or harvest date estimate at the central farm
* <span style="color:blue"> Blue lines</span> correspond to onset date (2015 to 2017 don’t have onset estimates yet)

# **To add: maps of planting/harvest estimates for neighboring polygons**



# **Notes**

**Choosing CAR polygons ‘of interest’**

* In MT, a polygon that coincided with Rally point and Dave’s sample point and that also was consistently planted from 2003 to 2017
* In Matopiba, a polygon that coincided with Dave’s sample point, a Matopiba survey point that had consistent reported data over the Matopiba survey years

**Filtering CAR polygons**

Used only polygons with:

* Total area > 2 km2
* Planted : total area ratio > 20% 
* Planting between 50 and 150 and harvest between 150 and 250 days after Aug 1
